  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: Jnuary 10, 2026</p>
  <p>Smart Expense Tracker (“the App”) is developed by <strong>Vivek</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles information collected from users.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Expense data you enter:</strong> amounts, categories, descriptions, attachments, and any other transaction details you add remain on your device unless you export or share them manually.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional attachments:</strong> if you attach receipts or images, they are stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash or performance data:</strong> Google Play may collect anonymized diagnostics as part of app distribution. We do not receive personally identifiable crash data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Display and organize your expenses, income, and reports.</li>
    <li>Generate PDF exports when you request them and share via the Android share sheet.</li>
    <li>Improve stability and performance based on aggregated diagnostics from Google Play (if available).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
  <p>All expense and attachment data stays on your device. The App does not upload your personal data to our servers. When you export or share a PDF, the file is generated locally and only shared with the destinations you choose (email, cloud storage, etc.). We do not sell or disclose your data to third parties.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage access:</strong> required to save PDF reports and attachments you choose to export.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Because data remains on your device, please keep your device secure with a PIN or biometric lock. We recommend regular backups if you install the app on multiple devices.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information, contact us to remove it.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy occasionally. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
